rails.vim
Remember when everybody and their mother was using TextMate for Ruby on Rails development? Well if it wasn't for rails.vim, we'd still be in that era. So shut up and pay some respect. And check out these features:

Easy navigation of the Rails directory structure. gf considers context and knows about partials, fixtures, and much more. There are two commands, :A (alternate) and :R (related) for easy jumping between files, including favorites like model to migration, template to helper, and controller to functional test. For more advanced usage, :Rmodel, :Rview, :Rcontroller, and several other commands are provided. :help rails-navigation
Enhanced syntax highlighting. From has_and_belongs_to_many to distance_of_time_in_words, it's here. For easy completion of these long method names, 'completefunc' is set to enable syntax based completion on CTRL-X CTRL-U.
Interface to rake. Use :Rake to run the current test, spec, or feature. Use :.Rake to do a focused run of just the method, example, or scenario on the current line. :Rake can also run arbitrary migrations, load individual fixtures, and more. :help rails-rake
Interface to script/*. Generally, use :Rscript about to call script/about or script/rails about. Most commands have wrappers with additional features: :Rgenerate controller Blog generates a blog controller and edits app/controllers/blog_controller.rb. :help rails-scripts
Partial extraction and migration inversion. :Rextract {file} replaces the desired range (ideally selected in visual line mode) with render :partial => '{file}', which is automatically created with your content. The @{file} instance variable is replaced with the {file} local variable. :Rinvert takes a self.up migration and writes a self.down. :help rails-refactoring
Integration with other plugins. :Rtree spawns NERDTree.vim. If dbext.vim is installed, it will be transparently configured to reflect database.yml. Users of abolish.vim get pluralize and tableize coercions, and users of bundler.vim get bundle exec rake. :help rails-integration
