#Confirmation flow


1. Admin will be able to see "Fees", "Confimed paid", "Balance"  in the pre_registration list view (done)
2. Admin will be able to key in comments and key in confirmed values for "Debate teams", "Adjudicator" and "Observer" (done)
3. The confirmed_values will be available in the Team manager profile page. (done)
4. The system will send an email to the Team manager when the confirmed_values are set by the Admin.

5. The profile page will also provide forms to key in "Debater", "Adjudicatory" and "Observer" details. There 
will be as many forms available in the profile page based as per the confirmed_values.

* How do we handle cases where the user has already keyed in participants but the amount of participants are changed in the backend?

* refactor participant templates
